I"²<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m a security engineer with more than a decade of experience juggling between breaking systems and helping teams build and ship more secure code. 
<br />I love hacking, Iâ€™m a big supporter of continuous learning and Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges.
<br />Also Iâ€™m a humorous person and I love sarcasm, so not eveything written here should be taken literally âš ï¸.</p>

<p>In my career Iâ€™ve worked across offensive security, cloud security, and Application Security, and Iâ€™m all about making security less of a blocker and more of a superpower.
<br />The last few years Iâ€™m working as a contractor for some F500 companies and I also do some ad-hoc assessments.</p>

<p>Here,in this blog I may rant about system insecurities (or mine ğŸ˜†).</p>
