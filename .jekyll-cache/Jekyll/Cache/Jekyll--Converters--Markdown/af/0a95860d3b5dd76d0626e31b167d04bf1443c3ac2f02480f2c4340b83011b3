  <h2 class="block-title line-top">Infrastructure Security Automation</h2>
</div>

<p>Iâ€™ll never forget the first time I attended a hacking conference, it was at Hactivity back in 2012 and I still remember Vivek Ramachandran talking about cracking WPA and WPA2, and Joe McCray talking about Web Application Security. 
Back then those guys where my heros without cape.</p>

<p>Anyways, that day I thoughtâ€¦ðŸ’­ one day I would like to speak here. 
<br />Few years later in 2020 when the pandemic hit, I submitted my first CFP at guess whereâ€¦.at hacktivity of course.</p>

<p>The topic was Infrastracture Security Automation with Ansible. An, as I call, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anorthodox</code> way to use ansible (at least it was back then). 
The presentation is about how Ansible can be used to run different Infrstracture security checks and it was part of a big project I was working for ING, my employer at that time.</p>

<p>In the presentation there is an ansible P0C role to demostrate some use cases. Of course, I continued working on that project for quite long and at some point it was running in CI/CD, then the project was adapted globally within ING and as far as I know it stills runs there.</p>

<p>So, if you are interested in watching the presentation and maybe dig deeper yourselve, you can find everything in <a href="https://github.com/r00tkie/Hacktivity_2020">this repo!</a></p>
