I’ll never forget the first time I attended a hacking conference, it was at Hactivity back in 2012 and I still remember Vivek Ramachandran talking about cracking WPA and WPA2, and Joe McCray talking about Web Application Security. 
Back then, those guys were my heroes without capes.

Anyways, that day I thought…💭 one day I would like to speak here.
<br>A few years later, in 2020, when the pandemic hit, I submitted my first CFP at guess where….hacktivity, of course.

The topic was Infrastructure Security Automation with Ansible. An, as I call, `anorthodox` way to use Ansible (at least it was back then). The presentation is about how Ansible can be used to run different Infrastructure security checks, and it was part of a large project I was working on for ING, my employer at the time.

In the presentation, there is an Ansible POC role that demonstrates various use cases. Of course, I continued working on that project for quite a long time, and at some point it was running in CI/CD, then the project was adapted globally within ING, and as far as I know, it still runs there.

If you're interested in watching the presentation and exploring the topic further, you can find everything in [this repository!](https://github.com/r00tkie/Hacktivity_2020)
