I'll never forget the first time I attended a hacking conference, it was at Hactivity back in 2012 and I still remember Vivek Ramachandran talking about cracking WPA and WPA2, and Joe McCray talking about Web Application Security. 
Back then those guys where my heros without cape.

Anyways, that day I thought...ðŸ’­ one day I would like to speak here. 
<br>Few years later in 2020 when the pandemic hit, I submitted my first CFP at guess where....at hacktivity of course. 

The topic was Infrastracture Security Automation with Ansible. An, as I call, `anorthodox` way to use ansible (at least it was back then). 
The presentation is about how Ansible can be used to run different Infrstracture security checks and it was part of a big project I was working for ING, my employer at that time. 

In the presentation there is an ansible P0C role to demostrate some use cases. Of course, I continued working on that project for quite long and at some point it was running in CI/CD, then the project was adapted globally within ING and as far as I know it stills runs there. 

So, if you are interested in watching the presentation and maybe dig deeper yourselve, you can find everything in [this repo!](https://github.com/r00tkie/Hacktivity_2020)
