Hey there! I‚Äôm a security engineer with more than a decade of experience juggling between breaking systems and helping teams build and ship more secure code. 
<br>I love hacking, I'm a big supporter of continuous learning and I'm always looking for new challenges.
<br>Also I'm a humorous person and I love sarcasm, so not eveything written here should be taken literally ‚ö†Ô∏è.

In my career I've worked across offensive security, cloud security, and Application Security, and I‚Äôm all about making security less of a blocker and more of a superpower.
<br>The last few years I'm working as a contractor for some F500 companies and I also do some ad-hoc assessments.

Here,in this blog I may rant about system insecurities (or mine üòÜ).
