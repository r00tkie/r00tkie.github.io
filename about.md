Hi There, 

It's <strong>d3adbef</strong> and this is my blog. 

I'm mostly interested in Offensive Security. This includes Red Teaming, Pentesting, AppSec and Cloud Security. 

The existance of this blog is to publish infosec related posts, guides and CTF realted content.
Things I know, things I learn and things I found on the internet

Not all posts here are my own research and many times articles are written using public knowledge.
